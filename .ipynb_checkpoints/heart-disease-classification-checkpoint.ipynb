    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes\n",

    "\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease\n",

    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from Cleavland data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation \n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has a heart disease during the proof of concept. we'll pursue the project.\n",

    "## 4. Features \n",
