    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes\n",

    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has a heart disease during the proof of concept. we'll pursue the project.\n",
